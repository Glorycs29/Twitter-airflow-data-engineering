Noted Weaknesses:

1. Twitter API Access Changes: Many viewers pointed out the limitations and changes in Twitter API access, leading to errors such as 403 Forbidden. This issue needs to be addressed as it significantly affects the project's viability.

Areas for Potential Innovation:

1. Alternative Data Sources: Since the Twitter API access has limitations, consider incorporating alternative data sources for similar projects. This could involve exploring public datasets or APIs from other social media platforms.
2. Variety of Use Cases: Expand the project scope to cover various use cases. This could involve creating similar projects for different platforms, analyzing different types of data, or exploring various ETL processes.

Suggestions for Best Practices Moving Forward:

1. Updated Documentation: Clearly document the changes in the Twitter API access and provide alternative solutions or workarounds for viewers encountering the 403 Forbidden error.
2. Exploration of Elevated Access: Provide a guide or explanation on how viewers can apply for elevated access through the Twitter Developer Portal.
3. Diversified Data Sources: Include guidelines on how viewers can utilize different data sources for similar projects, offering options that are more accessible and less affected by API changes.
4. Incorporate Error Handling: Integrate error handling mechanisms in the code to provide meaningful error messages and potential solutions when API-related errors occur.
5. Interactive Discussions: Engage with viewers through live sessions, Q&A videos, or comments to address specific questions and concerns related to the Twitter API changes and the project itself.
6. Tutorial Updates: If feasible, create a follow-up video or add annotations to the existing video that addresses the Twitter API access changes and offers solutions or alternatives.
